    <p class="p1">Our Story</p>
    <p class="we">
      We’re Kaleab Anteneh and Beimnet Girmay, two senior students who wanted to make a difference in our community. We realized that many students face challenges accessing education, and we wanted to do something about it. That’s how Bracelets For Education began—a small idea that turned into a mission. By creating and selling handmade bracelets, we found a way to combine our passion for creativity with our desire to help others.

    <p class="p1">Our Mission</p>
    <p class="we">
      Our goal is simple: make education accessible to students who need it most. Every bracelet sold directly supports learners, helping with school supplies, tuition, and other essential resources. We believe small actions can create meaningful change, and through our work, we hope to empower students to reach their full potential.
